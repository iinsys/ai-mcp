# AI Tools Usage Guide

Guide to using the AI development tools included in this repository.

## Available Tools

The AI tools are located in the `projects/tools/` directory. Each tool is designed to solve specific problems in AI development workflows.

## Tool Categories

### Data Processing Tools
Tools for preparing, cleaning, and transforming datasets for AI training and inference.

### Model Management Tools
Utilities for managing AI models, including deployment, versioning, and monitoring.

### Development Workflow Tools
Automation tools for common AI development tasks like testing, validation, and deployment.

### Integration Tools
Tools for connecting AI systems with external services and data sources.

## General Usage Pattern

Most tools follow this pattern:

1. **Installation**: Each tool has its own dependencies
2. **Configuration**: Tools use config files or environment variables
3. **Usage**: Command-line interface or Python API
4. **Output**: Results, logs, or processed data

## Getting Started

1. Browse the `projects/tools/` directory
2. Read the tool-specific README for installation instructions
3. Follow the examples provided with each tool
4. Check the troubleshooting section if you encounter issues

- Documentation expectations
- Testing requirements

## Common Patterns

### Configuration Management
```python
# Most tools use this pattern for configuration
from pathlib import Path
import yaml

def load_config(config_path: Path) -> dict:
    with open(config_path) as f:
        return yaml.safe_load(f)
```

### Error Handling
```python
# Consistent error handling across tools
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

try:
    # Tool operation
    pass
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    raise
```

### CLI Interface
```python
# Standard CLI pattern using Click
import click

@click.command()
@click.option('--input', required=True, help='Input file path')
@click.option('--output', required=True, help='Output file path')
def main(input: str, output: str):
    """Tool description."""
    # Implementation here
```

## Best Practices

- Always validate input data
- Provide clear error messages
- Include progress indicators for long operations
- Support both CLI and programmatic usage
- Include comprehensive logging
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Check if all dependencies are installed
2. **Permission errors**: Verify file and directory permissions
3. **Memory issues**: Consider processing data in chunks
4. **Configuration errors**: Validate config file format and values

### Getting Help

- `context-management/` - Advanced context handling strategies
- `security-models/` - New security approaches for MCP

## 🔬 Experiment Guidelines

### Starting an Experiment
1. Create a directory with a descriptive name
2. Add a README explaining the hypothesis
3. Document your approach and methodology
4. Keep notes on findings and iterations

### Experiment Structure
```

### Documentation
- **Hypothesis**: What are you trying to prove or explore?
- **Methodology**: How are you approaching the problem?
- **Progress Notes**: Regular updates on what you're learning
- **Results**: What worked, what didn't, and why
- **Next Steps**: Where to go from here

## 🤝 Sharing Experiments

- Document your process thoroughly
- Share interesting findings
- Ask for feedback and collaboration
- Turn successful experiments into tutorials or projects

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Experiments may contain broken or incomplete code
- Always document the current state and known issues
- Don't rely on experimental code for production use
- Feel free to abandon experiments that aren't working out

Remember: The goal is learning and discovery, not perfection!

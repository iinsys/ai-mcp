# Playground

A sandbox for quick tests, code snippets, and rapid prototyping.

## 🏗️ What Goes Here

- **Quick tests** - Small code snippets to test ideas
- **Code snippets** - Reusable pieces of code
- **Rapid prototypes** - Fast implementations to validate concepts
- **Debugging code** - Temporary code for troubleshooting
- **Learning exercises** - Practice code from tutorials

## 📁 Organization

Feel free to organize however works for you:

```
playground/
├── mcp-tests/         # Quick MCP-related tests
├── ai-snippets/       # AI development code snippets
├── utilities/         # Small utility functions
├── prototypes/        # Rapid prototypes
└── scratch/           # Temporary/throwaway code
```

## 🚀 Usage Guidelines

### Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names: `test-mcp-streaming.py` not `test1.py`
- Include dates for time-sensitive experiments: `2024-01-15-api-test.py`
- Add your initials if working in a team: `jd-weather-prototype.py`

### Documentation
- Add comments explaining what you're testing
- Include a brief header with the purpose
- Note any dependencies or setup required

### Example Header
```python
"""
Quick test: MCP server connection handling
Purpose: Test different connection timeout strategies
Author: Your Name
Date: 2024-01-15
Dependencies: mcp, asyncio
"""
```

## 🧹 Cleanup

The playground can get messy - that's okay! But consider:
- Moving successful prototypes to proper projects
- Deleting old, irrelevant code periodically
- Documenting useful snippets in the main codebase
- Sharing interesting findings with the team

## 💡 Tips

- **Start small** - Test one thing at a time
- **Iterate quickly** - Don't worry about perfect code
- **Document learnings** - Note what works and what doesn't
- **Share discoveries** - Help others learn from your experiments
- **Clean up occasionally** - Remove outdated or broken code

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### Testing New Libraries
```python
# Quick test of a new MCP feature
import mcp
# ... test code here
```

### Debugging Issues
```python
# Reproduce a bug in isolation
# ... minimal reproduction case
```

### Learning New Concepts
```python
# Following along with a tutorial
# ... practice code here
```

### Prototyping Ideas
```python
# Quick prototype of a new tool idea
# ... rough implementation
```

Remember: This is your space to experiment freely!
